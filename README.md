# Spring-Hibernate-Community
Simple micro-service I created to help me become more familiar with the Spring Framework using Hibernate and MySQL
This is a simple micro-service I built using Java and the Spring Boot Framework. I have used Java in many of my courses as 
I have worked to accomplish my Computer Science Degree. Java has always facinated me and I have really learned a lot 
about the nitty gritty of software development from learning Java development. I created this little application to 
connect to a MySQL database as a way to learn and practice using the Spring Boot Framework. I like how simple it is to map 
Java Objects to entries in a relational database using the Spring Framework tools. I also used Maven to manage dependencies 
and learned a lot building this little application. Hibernate adds some extra features that make it easy to query the database 
and return data in the command line. This is a simple application but can easily be added to and built on.
